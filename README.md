# Hadron Vault Infrastructure (Unus Nullus UAB)

This repository contains Hadron â€” the Unus Nullus UAB vault infrastructure: an appropriate, modular ERC4626-based system for
general-purpose vaults. It enables automated on-chain asset management via pluggable integrations ("fuses") while
keeping the core minimal and protocol-agnostic.
