# Hadron Vault Infrastructure (Unus Nullus UAB)

This repository contains Hadron â€” the Unus Nullus UAB vault infrastructure: an appropriate, modular ERC4626-based system for
general-purpose vaults. It enables automated on-chain asset management via pluggable integrations ("fuses") while
keeping the core minimal and protocol-agnostic.

## Technical Overview

For architecture details and usage guides, refer to the docs in this repository.

### Architecture Schema

The Hadron Vault is a minimal ERC4626 vault with modular protocol adapters called "gluons" executed via delegatecall. Core pieces are upgrade-friendly and use ERC-7201 namespaced storage.

Key points:
- HadronVault exposes standard ERC4626 (deposit, mint, withdraw, redeem) with role-gated access on sensitive functions.
- Gluons are protocol-specific adapters executed via `delegatecall` from the vault.
- Pre-hooks can enforce additional checks before selected function calls.
- Callback handler safely routes protocol callbacks only during active execution.
- Storage is centralized in `HadronVaultStorageLib` (ERC-7201). Supported fuses are tracked in `FuseStorageLib`.

### Execution Flow (execute with gluons)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Caller as Atomist/Owner
  participant Vault as HadronVault
  participant PreHooks as PreHooksHandler
  participant Gluon as Gluon (delegatecall)
  participant Prot as External Protocol

  Caller->>Vault: execute(FuseAction[] calls)
  Vault->>Vault: executeStarted()
  loop for each call
    Vault->>PreHooks: run pre-hook(selector)
    Vault->>Gluon: delegatecall fuse.data
    Gluon->>Prot: protocol-specific ops
    Prot-->>Gluon: callback
    Gluon-->>Vault: callback returns
    Vault->>Vault: handleCallback() via CallbackHandlerLib
  end
  Vault->>Vault: executeFinished()
  Vault->>Vault: _updateMarketsBalances()
  Vault-->>Caller: done
```

### ERC4626 Flows (simplified)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Vault as HadronVault (ERC4626)

  User->>Vault: deposit(assets, receiver)
  Vault-->>User: shares minted

  User->>Vault: withdraw(assets, receiver, owner)
  Vault-->>User: shares burned, assets transferred
```

## Installation

To install the dependencies for this project:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required Node.js packages listed in [package.json](./package.json).

## Smart Contract Development

This project uses Foundry for Ethereum smart contract development. To get started with Foundry:

1. Install Foundry by following [Foundry's installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/).
2. Build the smart contracts using:

```bash
forge build
```

## Testing

To run smart contract tests, you need to set up a `.env` file with the required environment variables.

### Environment Variables
An example `.env` file is in [.env.example](./.env.example). Copy this file to `.env` and fill in the required values.

- `ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_URL` - Ethereum provider URL
- `ARBITRUM_PROVIDER_URL` - Arbitrum provider URL
- `BASE_PROVIDER_URL` - Base provider URL
- `TAC_PROVIDER_URL` - TAC provider URL
- `INK_PROVIDER_URL` - Ink provider URL

Test smart contracts using:

```bash
forge test -vvv --ffi
```
